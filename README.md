###What is node?
Some ideas:
- Server-side JS platform
-IO in a special way
- Built on Google's V8
- Built in C

####Current ways to IO?
- Database, query DB, return result
- What is the web app doing while this is happening? (Nothing)
	- Big diff between your CPU and another server
	- Better software can multitask
	- Can have multiple threads running
